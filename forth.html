      <p>Sharada,
 The only name come into my mind whenever I stuck anywhere..
I remember how we first met in Trivandrum during our ILP .We both are searching for other person who is tagged to Tatasteel account when we got the list of associates tagged to projects .From being together in the same ILP batch and then we tagged to same Project and same team, we had great journey together. We had a lot of memories and good time that I will always cherish. I know how we used to laugh in the office , those small breaks from work , office parties , fun activities, Secret Santa and of course traditional day. We shared a personal bond that will never gonna break. You are very special and one of my best friends. I wish we could work together in future also.
Wish you the best for future..</p>
