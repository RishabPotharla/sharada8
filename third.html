      Finally the day came to say Farewell. Next Friday might be the last Friday's call that you are going to attend. It was always fun texting you in this call. I am going to miss having a banter with you from now . This meet is going to be so hard to attend as compared to my reverse KT.

      You are the first person I texted in this group just bcuz you look beautiful, and you are South Indian. Never thought that you will become one of my favourite person in the team. I have learnt alot from you both in personal and professional life and I always feel hard to say goodbye while talking to you in call.

      If you ever ignore me after going to IBM i will never forgive you.

      I am happy for you. I wish every thing  goes exactly as you planned.
